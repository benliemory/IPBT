# IPHM
Informative Prior Hierarchical Model

R package is provided in the IPHM_R_package folder. All the IPHM priors are built-in features in IPHM package.

All the IPHM priors are also summarized in the Informative_Priors folder in excel sheets. 
Although only variance is used for IPHM priors, we also provide the historical means for possible use.

Quick Installation Guide:
If R package "devtools" has been loaded, IPHM can be easily installed by following:
